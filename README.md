# fruit_selling_website

This is a personal project that creates a shopping website for Mr. Wang, a client of mine who is a fruit farmer. <br>
It uses Django as the server framework to create an interactive site with a shopping cart and user login/logout function.
The SQLite database is connected to the web app, therefore, Mr. Wang can update all the info however he wants.
<br>

However, due to time constrain, I couldn't get the online paying function to work as expected. <br>
Besides, Mr. Wang eventually founds that a combination of Google Sites and Google Forms suits his need just as well.<br>
So, this project wasn't put into real use, but it's a fun experience as a developer, and this repository was created for the record.
