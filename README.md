# fruit_selling_website

This is a high school personal project that creates a shopping website for Mr. Wang, a client of mine who is a fruit farmer.
It uses Django as the server framework to create an interactive site with a shopping cart and user login/logout function.
In other words, this has the basic CRUD functionality that a system with database should be able to do.
The SQLite database is connected to the web app, therefore, Mr. Wang can update all the info however he wants.

Due to time constrain, I didn't get the online paying function to work as expected. <br>
Besides, Mr. Wang eventually founds that a combination of Google Sites and Google Forms suits his need just as well.<br>
So, this project wasn't put into real use, but it's a fun experience and I learned a lot about the basic web framework
workflow with it.
